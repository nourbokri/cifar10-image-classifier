# \# CIFAR-10 Image Classification Project

# 

# \## Project Overview

# This project is developed as part of the Federated Project module.

# The goal is to design, train, evaluate, and deploy a deep learning model

# for multi-class image classification using modern Computer Vision techniques.

# 

# The project follows an end-to-end machine learning workflow:

# data preparation, model training, evaluation, experiment tracking,

# API deployment, and user interface demonstration.

# \## Dataset

# \*\*Dataset name:\*\* CIFAR-10  

# \*\*Task:\*\* Multi-class image classification  

# \*\*Number of classes:\*\* 10  

# \*\*Image size:\*\* 32×32 RGB images  

# \*\*Total images:\*\* 60,000  

# 

# \*\*Dataset source:\*\*  

# The dataset is automatically downloaded using:

# `torchvision.datasets.CIFAR10`

# 

# \*\*Why CIFAR-10?\*\*  

# CIFAR-10 is a well-known benchmark dataset for image classification.

# It is lightweight, well-documented, and suitable for training and

# evaluating convolutional neural networks.
